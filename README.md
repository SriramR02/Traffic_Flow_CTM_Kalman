# Traffic_Flow_CTM_Kalman
Traffic congestion impacts travel time, fuel use, and the environment. This study uses a stochastic Cell Transmission Model with Kalman filtering to estimate traffic flow on a 5 km lane. Simulated data over a morning peak show accurate density tracking, supporting real-time ITS applications.
